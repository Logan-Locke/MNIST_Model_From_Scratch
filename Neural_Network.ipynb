As I tried to understand what was happening in the code, I was taken down rabit hole after rabit hole searching YouTube and forums for the explanations. That's when I decided to organize everything I was learning.\n",

Anyone who meets those requirements should be able to follow along and understand this simple neural network using the MNIST digits dataset!\n",

    "# **Overview**\n",
    "The data we'll be working with is the MNIST dataset. It consists of tens of thousands handwritten images of digits. Thankfully, we don't have to worry about image processing because the images have been converted into values inside a .csv file. Each \"image\" now consists of a 28x28 grid of values (784 total), which has been transformed into a one-dimensional array. Each value is on a scale from 0 to 255, with 0 being completely black and 255 being completely white. By dividing these values by 255, we can normalize them to be on a scale from 0 to 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset is split into two files: the training data and the testing data. The training data is much larger than the testing data because our model will need a lot of information to try to correctly identify the handwritten digits in the testing data. These two datasets are completely disconnected from each other. The testing data will only be introduced to the model after we are completely done with training. From there, the model no longer updates its parameters, and it remains the same throughout the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one important distinction between the training and testing data, however. Each image in the training data is accompanied by a label that represents what digit that image represents. Therefore, each array of image data in the training data is actually 785 values (we'll separate the labels from each vector later). Now, we have tens of thousands arrays of length 785 to run through our model!\n",

    "## **Data Handling**\n",
    "Since each image is represented by a vector with 784 values, and we have tens of thousands of images, performing operations on these images would require a large amount of computational power. Thankfully, we can take advantage of vectorized calculations by stacking the vectors together into one matrix to increase efficiency. Vectorized calculations involve performing operations on entire arrays rather than individual elements, which significantly speeds up computation time. Some examples of vectorized calculations we'll implement are dot products, matrix multiplication, and element-wise operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most applications, these vectors would be represented as rows of the matrix with dimensions $m \\times n$ where $m$ is the number of training examples and $n$ is the number of input features (784). In linear algebra, $m$ refers to the number of rows and $n$ refers to the number of columns. Another alteration we're going to make to our data is transposing it. This is common practice in machine learning because it allows our data to adhere to the conventions of linear algebra and also specific algorithms. Now, our matrix will have dimensions $n \\times m$, with each column corresponding to a training example and each row a training feature. A transposed matrix is denoted by the addition of a superscripted $T$.\n",

    "## **Input Layer**\n",
    "The input layer is the very first layer of our neural network. Essentially, this layer's only purpose is to represent the input data, or input features. This layer is often disregarded when counting how many layers a network has, so ours would only be a two-layer neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the entire process of training our model, this layer will always have 784 nodes, or neurons. You can think of these as a unit of the neural network that holds and processes data. Individually, nodes don't do much. When you connect them to other nodes and apply functions to them however, that's how we make a neural network.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Hidden Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layer is the first layer of our network that performs some action on the data. The amount of nodes in any hidden layer is arbitrary, it's entirely up to you how many you want to incorporate. You can increase or decrease the amount as much as you like depending on the performance of the model. In fact, most neural networks have multiple hidden layers, but we're using one to keep things simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since no values are associated with the nodes in the hidden layer, now we have to perform some operation on the data. We're now going to introduce weights and biases to our model, each of which starts off as completely randomized values. These two parameters are the primary parameters that are updated during the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also going to apply an activation function to the values associated with the hidden layer. The choice of activation function is another element of a neural network that can be altered. For this, we're going to use what's called a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. ReLU will take in  \"weighted sums\", \"pre-activation values\", \"logits\" and perform an operation on each of those to return \"activations\", or \"activation values\".\n",
    "\n",
    "After ReLU is has been used, these values are ready to move onto the next layer.\n",

    "## **Output Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our output layer will have 10 nodes, one for each possible digit. We will introduce another set of weights and biases connecting the hidden layer to the output layer. Once again, we will apply an activation function to the pre-activation values specific to this layer. However, the output layer is going to use a different one than ReLU called a softmax function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A softmax function will transform our pre-activation values into an array of probabilities that sums up very nicely to 1. Essentially, each probability value of the output layer represents how confident the model is that a certain image is a particular digit. Now, we have our final output.\n",

    "## **Derivative Vs. Gradient**\n",
    "These two terms are used everywhere in machine learning. People use them interchangeably (including myself) without any issues, but there technically is a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Derivative**\n",
    "Measures how a function changes as its inputs change. The derivative of a loss function with respect to a parameter provides information about the sensitivity of the cost to changes in the parameters. It's useful when you have only one parameter to optimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient**\n",
    "A generalization of the derivative concept to functions with more than one input. It's a vector that points in the direction of steepest ascent of the loss function, with its magnitude representing the rate of increase in that direction. When we compute gradient descent, we find the gradient and move in the opposite direction (the steepest descent). Gradient is computed by taking the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to all the parameters.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Loss Function**\n",
    "When training a neural network, we don't compute the cost at each step. Furthermore, our code actually doesn't even explicitly calculate the cost at all, it only calculates the derivatives of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters. While we may not explicitly calculate the cost itself, we do calculate something directly derived from the loss function. Therefore, you could say we implicitly calculate the cost.\n",

    "Although factored out in our calculation of cost, the incorrect classes are, in fact, part of the backpropagation calculation and contribute to the gradient descent calculations. Ideally, the model shouldn't have given any probability to the incorrect classes. However, because it's learning, it did, and it needs to be corrected by adjusting the weights and biases. When training a multi-class classifier, the goal is not only to get the correct class right, but also to get the incorrect classes wrong. This ensures that the model is penalized more for making incorrect predictions, and less for making correct predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model predicts a high probability for the correct class (closer to 1), the difference will be small, leading to a smaller gradient and a smaller update to the parameters. Since the model is making correct predictions, we don't want to adjust the weights too much. If the model predicts a low probability for the correct class or a high probability for an incorrect class, the difference will be large, leading to a larger gradient and a larger update to the parameters. Since the model is making incorrect predictions, we want to change the parameters more to correct these errors.\n",

    "If the model's predicted probability for the correct class increases (i.e. the model is predicting more accurately), then $dZ^{[2]}$ for that class gets smaller (closer to 0) because $dZ^{[2]} = \\text{predicted probability} - 1$ Therefore, $dW^{[2]}$ also gets smaller, since it's directly computed using $dZ^{[2]}$. Conversely, if the model's predicted probability for the correct class decreases, then $dZ^{[2]}$ for that class gets larger (closer to 1). As a result, $dW^{[2]}$ gets larger too. To reinforce this, let's consider an example using the same variables in our code. Assume that we have a neural network with 3 classes, and the outputs from the hidden layer ($A^{[1]}$) and the output layer ($A^{[2]}$) are as follows:\n",

    "## **Overestimation and Underestimation**\n",
    "If the predicted probability of a class in $A^{[2]}$ is higher than the actual label, we can say the model overestimates that class. In our example, the model predicted 0.1 for Class 1 and 0.2 for Class 2, but the actual labels for these classes are 0. Therefore, the model overestimated the probabilities of Class 1 and Class 2. $dW^{[2]}$ will also be high, indicating that we need to push the weights in the direction that reduces the cost. Overestimating can lead to incorrect decisions. For example, in a medical diagnosis algorithm, if the model overestimates the correct class (e.g., predicts a disease that a patient does not have), it may lead to unnecessary medical treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overestimating can reduce the discriminative power of the model. When the predicted probability for the correct class is too high, it means the model is assigning high confidence to that class. This may result in the model becoming less sensitive to subtle differences between the correct class and other similar classes. This loss of sensitivity may reduce the model's ability to make nuanced distinctions and affect its overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the predicted probability of a class in $A^{[2]}$ is lower than the actual label, we can say the model underestimates that class. In our example, the model predicted 0.7 for Class 3, but the actual label for this class is 1. Therefore, the model underestimated the probability of Class 3. $dW^{[2]}$ will also be low, indicating that we need to push the weights in the direction that reduces the cost.\n",

    "## **Calibration**\n",
    "\"True probabilities\" refer to the actual frequencies of occurrence of each class within the dataset being modeled. Overestimating can indicate a lack of calibration in the model's predicted probabilities. A well-calibrated model should have predicted probabilities that closely reflect the true probabilities of the classes. A well-calibrated mode is one that provides predicted probabilities that align well with the true probabilities. For example, if the model assigns a predicted probability of $0.8$ to a certain class, it should mean that, on average, this class is expected to occur $80%$ of the time in reality.\n",

The model's predictions for those classes were too low (underestimated) relative to the true labels. Conversely, the negative values in $dW^{[2]}$ ($-0.18$ in our example) suggest that increasing the corresponding weights would decrease the cost.\n",
