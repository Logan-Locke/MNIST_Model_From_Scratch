    "# **Introduction**\n",
    "I started constructing this notebook after stumbling upon a video made by Samson Zhang. He explained how learning the foundational concepts of a neural network without the assistance of popular libraries/frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras enabled him to gain a more thorough understanding of machine learning. As I tried to understand what was happening in the code, I was taken down rabit hole after rabit hole searching YouTube and forums for the explanations. That's when I decided to organize everything I was learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this notebook elaborates on concepts that I personally didn't grasp at first, some of its contents may be quite easy to understand, while others that I did not cover in-depth may be challenging. In such cases, I challenge you to learn using the many available resources. This notebook is tailored towards someone with a surface-level understanding of calculus, linear algebra, and python. Anyone who meets those requirements should be able to follow along and understand this simple neural network using the MNIST digits dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was inspired by and modeled after one created by Samson Zhang, found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wwsalmon/simple-mnist-nn-from-scratch-numpy-no-tf-keras/notebook). I have added additional features and made some modifications to improve performance. Notably, I have significantly expanded on and edited the accompanying text to increase clarity.\n",

    "Additionally, I have implemented object-oriented programming (OOP) to improve modularity. **This guide will assume the use of 3 total layers with the hidden layer using ReLU as its activation function.** Knowing what those mean isn't important right now (we'll cover them later). **It will also use indexing throughout to represent these layers ([0], [1], [2])**. It's important that you remember that altering the number of layers and the activation functions may affect the logic of this guide.\n",

    "# **Overview**\n",
    "The data we'll be working with is the MNIST dataset. It consists of tens of thousands handwritten images of digits. Thankfully, we don't have to worry about image processing because the images have been converted into values inside a .csv file. Each \"image\" now consists of a 28x28 grid of values (784 total), which has been transformed into a one-dimensional array. Each value is on a scale from 0 to 255, with 0 being completely black and 255 being completely white. By dividing these values by 255, we can normalize them to be on a scale from 0 to 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset is split into two files: the training data and the testing data. The training data is much larger than the testing data because our model will need a lot of information to try to correctly identify the handwritten digits in the testing data. These two datasets are completely disconnected from each other. The testing data will only be introduced to the model after we are completely done with training. From there, the model no longer updates its parameters, and it remains the same throughout the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one important distinction between the training and testing data, however. Each image in the training data is accompanied by a label that represents what digit that image represents. Therefore, each array of image data in the training data is actually 785 values (we'll separate the labels from each vector later). Now, we have tens of thousands arrays of length 785 to run through our model!\n",
    "\n",
    "This network will have three total layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.\n",

    "## **Data Handling**\n",
    "Since each image is represented by a vector with 784 values, and we have tens of thousands of images, performing operations on these images would require a large amount of computational power. Thankfully, we can take advantage of vectorized calculations by stacking the vectors together into one matrix to increase efficiency. Vectorized calculations involve performing operations on entire arrays rather than individual elements, which significantly speeds up computation time. Some examples of vectorized calculations we'll implement are dot products, matrix multiplication, and element-wise operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most applications, these vectors would be represented as rows of the matrix with dimensions $m \\times n$ where $m$ is the number of training examples and $n$ is the number of input features (784). In linear algebra, $m$ refers to the number of rows and $n$ refers to the number of columns. Another alteration we're going to make to our data is transposing it. This is common practice in machine learning because it allows our data to adhere to the conventions of linear algebra and also specific algorithms. Now, our matrix will have dimensions $n \\times m$, with each column corresponding to a training example and each row a training feature. A transposed matrix is denoted by the addition of a superscripted $T$.\n",

    "The input layer is the very first layer of our neural network. Essentially, this layer's only purpose is to represent the input data, or input features. This layer is often disregarded when counting how many layers a network has, so ours would only be a two-layer neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the entire process of training our model, this layer will always have 784 nodes, or neurons. You can think of these as a unit of the neural network that holds and processes data. Individually, nodes don't do much. When you connect them to other nodes and apply functions to them, however, that's how we make a neural network.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Hidden Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layer is the first layer of our network that performs some action on the data. The number of nodes in any hidden layer is arbitrary, it's entirely up to you how many you want to incorporate. You can increase or decrease the amount as much as you like depending on the performance of the model. In fact, most neural networks have multiple hidden layers, but we're using one to keep things simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since no values are associated with the nodes in the hidden layer, now we have to perform some operation on the data. We're now going to introduce weights and biases to our model, each of which starts off as completely randomized values. These two parameters are the primary parameters that are updated during the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also going to apply an activation function to the values associated with the hidden layer. The choice of activation function is another element of a neural network that can be altered. For this, we're going to use what's called a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. ReLU will take in \"weighted sums\", \"pre-activation values\", \"logits\" and perform an operation on each of those to return \"activations\", or \"activation values\".\n",

    "Our output layer will have 10 nodes, one for each possible digit. We will introduce another set of weights and biases connecting the hidden layer to the output layer. Once again, we will apply an activation function to the pre-activation values specific to this layer. However, the output layer is going to use a different one than ReLU called a softmax function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A softmax function will transform our pre-activation values into an array of probabilities that sums up very nicely to 1. Essentially, each probability value of the output layer represents how confident the model is that a certain image is a particular digit. Now, we have our final output.\n",

It adjusts towards the direction of the steepest descent in the loss function gradient. It utilizes the chain rule to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter.\n",

    "There are various implementations of gradient descent, but we are implementing what's called \"batch gradient descent\" because it's pretty straightforward. This implementation calculates the average gradient of the loss function over all training examples before updating the parameters (i.e., all images are run forwards and backwards at the same time). It results in accurate, but computationally expensive calculations.\n",

    "To find $\\frac{\\delta L_{CE}}{\\delta \\hat{y}_i}$, let's consider an example with three classes: Class 0, Class 1, and Class 3. The softmax outputs for the classes are represented as  $\\hat{y}_0$, $\\hat{y}_1$, and $\\hat{y}_2$, and the true label for the input is represented by a one-hot encoded vector $y = [y_0, y_1, y_2]$. For this, the loss function calculation is:\n",
    "$$L_{CE} = -\\sum_{i=0}^{2} y_i \\cdot \\log(\\hat{y}_i)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "All $y_i = 0$ except for the correct class, where $y_i = 1$. For example, let's say Class 1 is the correct class, then $y = [0, 1, 0]$. Now, let's calculate the derivative of $L_{CE}$ with respect to $\\hat{y}_0$, $\\hat{y}_1$, and $\\hat{y}_2$:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\delta L_{CE}}{\\delta \\hat{y}_0} = -{\\frac{0}{\\hat{y}_0}} = 0$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\delta L_{CE}}{\\delta \\hat{y}_1} = -{\\frac{1}{\\hat{y}_1}} $$\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\delta L_{CE}}{\\delta \\hat{y}_2} = -{\\frac{0}{\\hat{y}_2}} = 0$$\n",

    "When $i$ does not equal the index of the correct class: $$\\frac{\\delta L_{CE}}{\\delta \\hat{y}_i} = 0$$\n",
