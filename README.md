# MNIST Model From Scratch

Educational, beginner-friendly notebooks with step-by-step documentation on how to create a fully modular neural network from scratch (no TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras).

If you are struggling with the mathematics or concepts behind neural networks, these notebooks can help reinforce these concepts. However, they still assume you have at least some previous knowledge on the subjects.

I recommend starting with the `Neural_Network_OOP.ipynb` notebook because it is easier to manage, but the `Neural_Network.ipynb` notebook is a great alternative if object-oriented programming (OOP) is still somewhat unfamiliar to you.
