# MNIST Model

Beginner-friendly notebooks that demonstrate step-by-step how to create a neural network from scratch without external libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras.

If you are struggling with the calculus or linear algebra within neural networks, you are exactly who I built these notebooks for. There is a lot of help to reinforce these concepts, but these notebooks still require some degree of knowledge on the subjects.

I reccomend starting with the `Neural_Network.ipynb` notebook if you are unfamiliar with object-oriented programming (OOP) because it is easier to follow along with. Otherwise, start with the `Neural_Network_OOP.ipynb` or `Neural_Network_OOP_Lite.ipynb` notebooks because they are more modular.
